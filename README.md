# United States President Performances (1969-2021)

I embark on a journey using economic indicators and sociological metrics to determine which US President has performed best on both ends of the spectrum. There will be many economic indicators and the ever-so favorite, the public approval rating regarding the presidents' performance on the public relations end. This will be a project only on available metrics in economics, such as GDP, inflation rates, unemployment rates, SP500 values, and many more. A machine learning model will search these candidates for the best possible metrics between all the variables. 

## Roadmap

- Collecting all necessary economic metrics
- Collecting all necessary sociological metrics
- Cleaning and prepping data into proper tables
- Visualizing data based on every president's performance
- Selecting proper machine learning models to make a decision
- Conclusion as to which president delivered the most
